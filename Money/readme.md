# Money First bank of Brimstone 

(~2025-07) Printed the "money" for the game. Got images from BBG and make the Layout.

# Files

Print - MiniUSA - A4 8x/ => Another layout with more cutting lines. The PDF is inside.
	MiniUSA A4 8x - 1F.jpeg => reference for the front
	MiniUSA A4 8x - 1V.jpeg> Reference for the Back (Verso)

Print - FBB MiniUSA A4/ => PDFs for each note value (5, 10, 25, 100, 500). Each PDF prints 8 notes front and back.
	As usual, print, laminate, cut in the middle (continuous line). 
	Then fold in the dashed lines (2 for each half) paying attention to the alignment. Make a crest to make it easy to fold in the right way to make the alignment perfect.
	With the marked fold crest spread glue and fold. Fold to glue, press and wait to dry.
	Cut in the marked lines.

Layout - MiniUSA - A4 8x => Layout used to generate "Print - MiniUSA - A4 8x/"

So, after long discussions and many hours spent designing, reworking, finding source material, and designing some more, the First Bank of Brimstone's Gold Certificates are ready!

So, what are we talking about exactly? It's quite simple actually. I've designed a set of cards to serve as currency in your games of Shadows of Brimstone. The idea behind these is that you won't have to spend your time keeping a running total of your gold throughout a mission and will get to spend more time staring down the barrel of your shotgun into the eyes of a Night Terror.

They're meant to be printed on bridge-sized cards (2.25" x 3.5") and come in various denominations (5$, 10$, 25$, 100$, 500$ and 1000$). The proposed distribution amongst these denominations is:
    12 x 5$
    12 x 10$
    36 x 25$
    30 x 100$
    12 x 500$
    6  x 1000$


So, how do you get a hold of these to pimp out your game?

Method 1: Buy a pre-designed deck straight off PrinterStudio!

I put together a 108 card deck, using the above distribution which is available here.

Disclaimer: With this link I get a small cut of the price.


Method 2: Design your own deck on PrinterStudio!

With the high-resolution, high-quality JPG files available here, you can design your own deck of up to 234 cards right here.


Method 3: Print your own deck at home!

With a bit or work, you could use the JPG files linked previously to print out a deck of cards using any color printer!

The JPG files are designed to be printed out at 4"x2.75", and then have 0.25" cut off each side. This is called "bleed" in printing terms, and is so the printed color continues to the edge of the paper.


For the original discussions, and to see the evolution of these cards, see this thread, starting about half way down page 4.
