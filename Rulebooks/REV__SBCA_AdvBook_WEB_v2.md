_“Hunched and lumbering, this towering behemoth dwarfed all other creatures my expedition has encountered! Its large head covered in soulless black eyes with a wide, round mouth surrounded by an array of sharp teeth. A dozen long tongues erupted from its face and writhed in a hypnotic dance.” _ - Excerpt from the journals of Dr. Tobias Hedgebrook

# THE STORY OF BRIMSTONE

There was a town, if you could call it that, named Brimstone; a small railway stop on the edge of the hottest deserts in the Southwest Territory. Barely a speck, it didn’t even show up on most maps... That is, until they found the Dark Stone.

Digging in the hills, an old prospector came across a strange nugget he had never seen before, a black rock, part way between a crystal and a metal ore. But there was something special about that rock, it had a glow you could only see out of the corner of yer eye and was warm to the touch. It had properties folks said were magik, and of course, that caused a stir.

Within days they found more of it buried in the earth, and stories started to spread. Business men and scholars started offering top dollar for even the smallest shard of the stuff, and that opened the floodgates.

It was a gold rush, but not for gold; for the black rock... The Dark Stone. People came from all over to try and make their fortune, and Brimstone boomed over night. They dug mines in every scrap of land they could get ahold of.

Round the clock they worked, digging deeper and deeper into the earth, bringing up cartloads full of the rock and sending it back to town to be stockpiled and sold to the highest bidder.

What they didn’t know, what nobody knew, was that as they collected more and more of that black rock all in one place, it started to react, until...

It exploded! In a flash, the town was consumed and a shockwave rolled out across the desert, burning the trees and tainting the land.

Reality itself was being ripped apart, and the people along with it. Dark portals to other worlds started tearing open across the countryside, pulling people in and unleashing all manner of demons and creatures into our world.

Wherever there was Dark Stone these gateways would appear; some only flickering open for an instant, others opened and stayed that way.

That was 6 months ago. Since then, demonic creatures of all kinds have been pouring out of the mines, and the scorched hell on earth that is...was Brimstone.

The government denies its existence, and anyone sane steers clear of the whole area, but plenty of folks find they can’t help but be drawn in, whether it’s to try and help somehow or just to find a fortune of their own, it don’t matter.

Everyone wants to be a hero. The damn fools! No one ever escapes... the Shadows of Brimstone.

##### Quick and the Dead

In the Southwest, there’s only two types of gunfighters, the quick and the dead. At least that WAS the case until infamous gunslinger and gambler Leo ‘Dusty’ Marvin was shot dead in the street during a duel. The next morning, he stumbled back into the saloon and sat down to play a hand of cards. Death, it seemed, had taken his life and his looks, but not his love of poker, or his speed on the draw...as his former rivals soon discovered.

##### The Hangin’ Judge

With a cruel and unforgiving fist, Judge Octavian Bishop of Cantorsville is ruthless in his swift justice on outlaws, thieves, and mutants. He prides himself on the ‘speedy trial’, often arresting, convicting, and hanging folks in a single afternoon. He even likes to pull the lever on the gallows himself, just to watch ‘em swing! Rumor has it, though, that the Judge has more than a few secrets of his own to hide.

# MISSIONS

Missions are the backbone of the **_Shadows of Brimstone_** , describing a story set up, the goals, special rules, and reward for
successfully completing the Adventure. There are 12 different Missions included in this Core Set, and each can be played many
times, as the map, cards, and story unfold differently every time you play.

## SELECTING A MISSION

When you are setting up for a game of Shadows of Brimstone , one of the key factors is deciding what Mission you will play. The For a Few Dark Stone More Mission is a great entry point for all groups of new Heroes starting their career of adventure.

### Rolling Randomly vs Choosing

When you are ready for your next Adventure, you can either select a Mission from the list to play, or, if you are feeling adventurous, you can roll randomly to determine your next Mission using the list below.

If you are new to the game, it is recommended that you play though several of the Basic Missions before moving on to any of the Advanced Missions.


### Mission List

Below is a list of all of the Missions found in the City of the Ancients Core Set for Shadows of Brimstone. There are 6 Basic Missions, and 6 Advanced Missions unique to this Core Set.

==**D6 Roll Mission Type**==

1-3 **Basic Mission**

4-6 **City of the Ancients Mission**

==**D6 Roll Basic Missions**==

1 **For a Few Dark Stone More**

2 **Exploration**

3 **Seal the Void Gate**

4 **Search Party**

5 **Escape**

6 **Blow the Mine**

==**D6 Roll City of the Ancients Missions**==

1 **Terror in the Night**

2 **Stop the Ritual**

3 **Last Stand**

4 **City of the Ancients**

5 **Overload**

6 **Frozen Expedition**

### Linking Missions

When playing as a campaign and keeping your Heroes from game to game, it is sometimes fun to link your Missions thematically, one after another. Though none of the Missions introduced here directly affect one another, it is easy to imagine how they might be chained together to form a narrative.

For example, if you play Exploration and succeed, you may determine that you need to Seal the Void Gate that you discovered along the way. While if you failed, you might need to form a Search Party to rescue someone carried off by the Darkness you let escape. Then if you failed to Seal the Void Gate, perhaps you should really just Blow the Mine, as it’s the only way to be sure. While if you succeeded, maybe too many creatures got through before the gate was sealed and now you have to Escape to get away alive. The narrative possibilities are endless.


## MISSIONS FEATURES

### Elements of a Mission

Every Mission has a short story description as well as
several features.

### Set Up describes the starting board arrangement and any special markers or cards the Heroes start with.

### Mission Goal describes what the Heroes need to do to complete the Mission.

### Special Rules tell what extra rules are used that are specific to the Mission.

### Objectives describes what Clue Icons are used for during the Mission (if relevant) as well as what the final Objective Room may hold. It also tells how the Mission is successfully completed by the Heroes.

### Reward details what bonuses the Heroes get if they successfully complete the Mission.

### Failure tells what happens if the Heroes lose the Mission - by all being KO’d, letting the Darkness Escape the Mines, etc.

### Mission Special Rules
Most Missions have one or more **Special Rules**. Often, the same Special Rule can be found in multiple different Missions.

Special Rules marked with ‘ **(Objective)** ’ specifically relate to the **Objectives** of the Mission (usually only taking effect while in the final Objective Room).

## FIXED MAP MISSIONS

Some Missions use a fixed map rather than a randomly generated board. For these Missions, the board is created at the start of the game, as shown in the Mission’s Set Up section and map diagram.

The Map Decks are generally not used for these Missions as the entire Map is constructed during Set Up.

### Exploration Tokens

Exploration Tokens (if used) are placed on the board as shown in the map diagram. As normal, during the Room Exploration phase of the turn, if there are one or more Heroes on a Map Tile with an Exploration Token, that Token is revealed.

```
Once a Hero has entered a Map Tile with an Exploration Token on it, that Hero may not leave that Map Tile until the end of the turn.
```

This prevents Heroes from moving through an un- Explored Room without triggering the Exploration Token to be revealed.

A Hero may, however, move onto one of the puzzle connection spaces in the Room, connected to another Map Tile, as they will still be on both Map Tiles. If that Map Tile also has an Exploration Token, both of them will be revealed during the Room Exploration phase.

```
During a Fight, models may not move onto a Map Tile that has an unrevealed Exploration Token.
```

### New Doors and Gates

Door and Gate Icons on Exploration Tokens are not used
in Fixed Map Missions, as the board is already pre-set. Any
time a Gate or new Door would appear (from an Encounter
card, etc.), ignore that new Door or Gate, it simply does not
come into play.

### Placing Enemies

With a Fixed Map, Rooms no longer always have an obvious ‘Entrance’. Because normal Enemy placement starts at the opposite side of the Room from the ‘Entrance’, simply treat the side of the Room that the Heroes moved onto the Map Tile from as the ‘Entrance’ to that Room. If Heroes moved onto the Map Tile from two different directions in the same turn, roll off to see which of the two sides counts as the ‘Entrance’.

# ~Basic Mission 1 -~ FOR A FEW DARK STONE MORE

```
Sitting in a saloon one afternoon, you overhear talk of a local mine up in the hills that has a large deposit of Dark Stone, just waiting for someone to come and claim it. It sounds too good to be true...and it probably is, but the old prospector swears up and down that he would go claim it himself if he were twenty years younger.

It’s not hard to figure out which mine system he’s talking about based on the landmarks he mentions, and though the other patrons he tells just dismiss him, this could be the big score you’ve been looking for.
```

### Set Up
This Mission uses the standard set up and all Heroes start on the **_Mine Entrance_** Map Tile as normal.

## Mission Goal
The Heroes are searching for a deposit of valuable Dark Stone up in the hills. To reach the Dark Stone deposit that they are looking for, the Heroes must find enough Clue Icons on Exploration Tokens to lead them to the Objective.

There are three variations for this Mission and the Heroes must choose before the Mission begins which Mission Length they want to embark on.

==**Mission Length - Objective**==

**Small Deposit - Find 2 Clues**

**Medium Deposit - Find 3 Clues**

**Large Deposit - Find 4 Clues**

### Special Rules

There are no Special Rules for this Mission.

### Objectives

When the final Clue is discovered, the Heroes have found the Dark Stone deposit they were looking for! Ignore any **_Attacks_** or **_Encounters_** listed on the final Exploration Token. Also, ignore any Door/Gate Icons on the token, as the Objective Room has no exits.

Reveal all **Growing Dread** cards in the stack as normal and then the Heroes must face an **Epic Threat**. Once all Enemies have been defeated, the Heroes have successfully completed the Mission!

### Reward

The XP gained and amount of Dark Stone that the Heroes find in the deposit is based on the Mission Length they chose before the Mission began, as noted below. Each Hero receives the Reward for completing the Mission.

==** Mission Length - Reward**==

**Small Deposit 25 XP and D3 Dark Stone**

**Medium Deposit 50 XP and D3+1 Dark Stone**

**Large Deposit 75 XP and D3+2 Dark Stone**

### Failure

If the Heroes fail the Mission, the Darkness escapes the Mines and wreaks havoc on the countryside and the neighboring Towns.

When the Heroes Travel to a Frontier Town before the next Adventure, D3 Random Buildings there will have been Destroyed by the escaping Darkness.

# ~Basic Mission 2 -~ EXPLORATION

```
You have been hired by a foreign investor to investigate and explore a claim that he has just purchased in the area. He will pay you well if it pans out to be half as a good a deal as he was lead to believe.

All you have to do is see how big the mine really is and clean out any unsavory squatters that have moved in. Sounds simple, right? It always does.
```

### Set Up
This Mission starts with the **Mine Entrance** Map Tile leading directly to a **_T-Junction_** Map Tile. All Heroes start on the **_Mine Entrance_** Map Tile as normal. Remove a **T-Junction** Map Card from the **Mine Map Deck**. Note that the Hero Posse marker is not moved forward a step on the Depth Track for this _T-Junction_.

### Mission Goal
The Heroes must explore the entire Mine (not including any **Gates** they might find along the way) and defeat all Enemies they come across to successfully complete this Mission.

### Special Rules

#### Limited Doors
All Exploration Tokens with a Clue Icon have one less Door/Gate on them (Heroes’ Choice).

Any time you reveal an Exploration Token, roll a D for each Door/Gate Icon on that Token. On the roll of 4+, ignore that Door/Gate Icon. While the Hero Posse marker is in the middle Stage of the Depth Track, ignore on a 3+ instead. While the Hero Posse marker is in the last Stage of the Depth Track, ignore all Door/Gate Icons automatically.

#### Dead End Showdowns
Whenever a _Dead End_ Room is found (a Room Map Tile that has no Exits), roll a D6.

```
1 - Add an **Epic Threat** to the Exploration Token.
2-3 - Add a normal **Threat** to the Exploration Token.
4-6 - There is no extra Threat here.
```

#### Immediate Dread
For this Mission, **_Growing Dread_** cards are revealed immediately when drawn rather than being placed on the stack.

### Objectives
Once the Heroes have explored the entire Mine (all paths lead to a _Dead End_ Room - if a Room has only Gates as Exits, this counts as a _Dead End_ ), they must defeat any remaining Enemies on the board to complete the Mission.

### Reward
Each Hero receives 25 XP as well as $50 x the number of steps on the Depth Track the Hero Posse marker is from the Mine Entrance space. For example - If the Hero Posse marker is on the 10 space of the Depth Track when the Mine has been fully explored, each Hero will earn $300 ($50 x 6 steps from the Mine Entrance ).

### Failure
If the Heroes fail the Mission, the Darkness escapes the Mine and lays waste to the roads and towns in the area. When the Heroes Travel to Town after this Adventure, they must each roll twice to see if they add a Travel Hazard to the journey. Also, 1 Random Building in Town will have been Destroyed by the escaping Darkness.

# ~Basic Mission 3 -~ SEAL THE VOID GATE

```
A stable Void Gate has opened deep in a nearby mine and all manner of horrific monstrosities are pouring out! Finding a way to seal the gate within an ancient occult tome, the local Holy Man lead a group down into the mine a few days ago to try to put a stop to the rampage. They have not been heard from since, and the waves of creatures are getting stronger and more frequent. Something must be done, or this entire area will be overrun in a matter of days!
```

### Set Up
This Mission uses the standard set up and all Heroes start on the **_Mine Entrance_** Map Tile as normal.

### Mission Goal
The Heroes must discover the fate of the previous expedition and retrieve the Occult Book. They must then find the Void Gate and use the Book to collapse and seal it.

### Special Rules

#### Leading Darkness
Due to the extra Void energies surrounding the area, the Darkness moves D3+1 steps on the Depth Track at the start of the game (after set up but before the first turn). This may lead to an immediate Attack on the Heroes as they approach the entrance.

#### Creature Summoning (Objective)
During the final Fight, anytime the **_Hold Back the Darkness_** roll is failed, roll a D6. On the roll of 1, 2, or 3, immediately add a **Low Threat** card to the Fight. These Enemies are placed normally (not in **Ambush** ).

#### Sealing the Gate (Objective)
While on the same Map Tile as the Gate, the Hero with the **Occult Book** may attempt to read from it once per turn, during his Activation. Make a **Spirit 5+** test. For every 5+ rolled, gain **10 XP** and place a Sanity marker on the Gate. When there are 5 or more Sanity markers on the Gate, it is Sealed and the Gate End Cap is replaced with a normal End Cap.

### Objectives

#### The First Clue

The **First Clue** the Heroes find is the location of the ill- fated previous expedition as well as the location of the **Occult Book** they were carrying with them. Ignore any **_Attacks_** or **_Encounters_** listed on this Exploration Token. Instead the Heroes must draw a Threat card that is one Threat Level higher than normal to battle. These are the creatures that killed the first expedition. At the end of this Fight, the Heroes find the Occult Book amongst the bodies of the fallen and
may choose which Hero will carry it.

#### The Second Clue

The Second Clue the Heroes find is the location of the Void Gate! Ignore any Attacks or Encounters listed on this Exploration Token. Also, ignore any Door/Gate Icons on the token, as the Objective Room has only one exit and that is the Void Gate (a Gate End Cap). Heroes may not move through the Void Gate as it leads directly into the abyss of the Void.

Reveal all Growing Dread cards in the stack as normal and then the Heroes must face an Epic Threat that is guarding the Void Gate. As long as the Void Gate is open, the Creature Summoning rule above is active in the final Room. Also, the Hero with the Occult Book may use the Sealing the Gate rule above. If the Hero with the Occult Book is KO’d, the book drops in their space and may be picked up for free by any other Hero moving into that space.

Once the Void Gate has been Sealed and all remaining Enemies have been defeated, the Heroes have successfully completed the Mission.

### Reward
Each Hero receives 25 XP as well as D6x$50 for their efforts.

### Failure
If the Heroes fail the Mission, the surge of creatures from the Void Gate destroys all of the towns nearby. The Heroes may not visit a Frontier Town, but instead must proceed directly on to the next Adventure.

# ~Basic Mission 4 -~ SEARCH PARTY

```
Dragged off in the night, one of the local frontier folk has gone missing, and there are signs of a struggle leading into the hills. No one else around these parts is willing to do anything about it, due to the sheer number of vile creatures roaming those hills, but you can’t bring yourselves to simply walk away. Not this time.
```

### Set Up
This Mission uses the standard set up and all Heroes start on the Mine Entrance Map Tile as normal.

### Mission Goal
One of the local frontier folk has gone missing and everyone fears the worst. Organizing your Posse for a search, you must find 3 Clue Icons before it’s too late to find them alive.

Roll a D6 to determine who has gone missing. This will also determine the Reward if you can bring them back alive.

```
**D6 Roll Person Missing**

1-2 **A Farmer’s Son**
3-4 **The Preacher’s Daughter**
5-6 **The Local Doc**
```

### Reward
If the Heroes successfully complete the Mission, each Hero gains 50 XP. If the missing person was brought back alive, they also gain the following Reward based on who was rescued:

```
**Person Rescued Reward**

A Farmer’s Son - D6x$50 and you may remove D3 Corruption

The Preacher’s Daughter - $100 and Gain +1 Sanity

The Local Doc - $100 and Gain +1 Health
```

### Special Rules
There are no Special Rules for this Mission.

### Objectives

**The Third Clue**

When the **Third Clue** is discovered, the Heroes have found the location of the person they were looking for! Ignore any **_Attacks_** or **_Encounters_** listed on the final Exploration Token. Also, ignore any Door/Gate Icons on the token, as the Objective Room has no exits.

Reveal all **Growing Dread** cards in the stack as normal and then the Heroes must face an **Epic Threat** that is guarding the unconscious or dead body of the missing townsfolk. Place a KO’d Hero marker in any space of the final Objective Room to represent the body (models may occupy this space and the body may not be interacted with in any way. It is only for thematic purposes).

Once all Enemies have been defeated, the Heroes have successfully completed the Mission! If the Hero Posse marker on the Depth Track is in the first Stage, roll 1 die, if it’s in the middle Stage, roll 2 dice, and if it’s in the last Stage roll 3 dice. If any of the dice roll a 1, it is too late, and the missing person is already dead. If none of the dice roll a 1, they are still alive, but just barely. This roll may not be Re-rolled.

### Failure
If the Heroes fail the Mission, each Hero takes D3 Corruption Points , ignoring Willpower, as the loss weighs heavily on their souls.


# ~Basic Mission 5 -~ ESCAPE

```
Something went terribly wrong after that last mission and now you’re deep in the mines and surrounded! You must find a way out before you are overwhelmed and devoured by the Darkness that is chasing you!
```

### Set Up

This Mission starts with the Heroes already down in the Mines, with just a **_Cross Path_** Map Tile. All Heroes start on the **_Cross Path_** , and may be placed in any spaces they like. All four exits of the **_Cross Path_** are considered **Doors**. 

Remove a **Cross Path** Map Card from the **Mine Map Deck**. Note that the Hero Posse marker is not moved forward a step on the Depth Track for this _Cross Path_.

### Mission Goal
Chased by the Darkness, the Heroes must find a way out of this forsaken Mine before they are devoured in the deep. They must explore the Mine until they find the **_Mine Entrance_** Map Tile to escape through.

### Special Rules

#### Surrounded by Darkness

_As you frantically Search for a way to escape the Darkness, it closes in around you._ Any time the Heroes find an Exploration Token with a **Clue Icon** , it moves the Hero Posse marker one extra step forward on the Depth Track, but also adds an extra Threat card to the Token. If it is already an **Attack** or **Ambush Attack** , this is an extra Threat card for that Fight (the additional Enemies will Ambush as well if it is already an **Ambush Attack** ). If the Exploration Token was an **Encounter** , this makes it an **Attack** as well with a single Threat card.

#### Dangerous Escape (Objective)
At the end of any turn in which one or more Heroes is standing on the **_Mine Entrance_** Map Tile as the Objective Room, roll a special **_Hold Back the Darkness_** test (ignore _Depth Events_ ). If failed, the Darkness marker is not moved, but instead there is an **Epic Threat** there waiting for you that must be defeated to escape! If the test is successful, the coast is clear and the Heroes are able to hightail it, escaping without incident.

#### Immediate Dread
For this Mission, **_Growing Dread_** cards are revealed immediately when drawn rather than being placed on the stack.

#### May Not Flee
Once the Adventure begins, the Heroes may not Flee; they are trapped, and must see the Mission through to the end.

### Objectives

##### Find the Mine Entrance to Escape

Any time a new Map Tile is placed, move the Hero Posse marker as normal and then roll 2D6 (this roll may not be Re-rolled). If the roll is equal to or higher than the current position of the Hero Posse marker on the Depth Track, the Heroes have found the Mine Entrance!

Ignore any Door/Gate Icons on the Exploration Token for the Map Tile just placed (if there is an Exploration Token), as it has only one exit, leading to the Mine Entrance Map Tile as the final Objective Room (this uses the Dangerous Escape Special Rule). Once the Heroes escape (after defeating any Enemies on the last normal Map Tile placed and/or for the Dangerous Escape Special Rule), the Mission is successfully completed.

### Reward
Each Hero receives 100 XP.

### Failure
If the Heroes fail the Mission, each Hero must discard one Gear or Artifact card with a listed Gold value of at least $200 as it is lost in the frantic dash to escape the Darkness. Any Hero that cannot discard a Gear or Artifact like this must instead roll once on the Injury Chart using a D8 instead of the normal 2D6 (in addition to any Injury for being KO’d).

# ~Basic Mission 6 -~ BLOW THE MINE

```
That’s it! There are just too many Gates opening up and creatures coming out of the local mine to handle. When one Gate closes, two more open up around it! There’s only one thing for it, you’ll have to blow the mine! Collecting up all the heavy-duty explosives the local Frontier Town has to offer, you set off into the depths to find a couple of good spots to plant the charges that will collapse the entrance tunnels for good.

Of course, the only trick is that you also have to get out before it blows. This one’s gonna be close!
```

### Set Up
This Mission starts with the **Mine Entrance** Map Tile leading directly to a **_T-Junction_** Map Tile. All Heroes start on the **_Mine Entrance_** Map Tile as normal. The Heroes start with **2 Explosives** markers to plant in the Mine.

Remove a **T-Junction** Map Card from the **Mine Map Deck**. Note that the Hero Posse marker is not moved forward a step on the Depth Track for this _T-Junction_.

### Mission Goal
The Heroes must explore the Mine far enough to find and place **Explosives** at a _Dead End_ Room (a Room with no Exits) on each side of the _T-Junction_ (two total). They must then return to the _Mine Entrance_ Map Tile to escape before the charges blow! This will successfully complete the Mission.

### Special Rules

#### Limited Doors
All Exploration Tokens with a Clue Icon have one less Door/Gate on them (Heroes’ Choice).

Any time you reveal an Exploration Token, roll a D6 for each Door/Gate Icon on that Token. On the roll of 4+, ignore that Door/Gate Icon. While the Hero Posse marker is in the middle Stage of the Depth Track, ignore on a 3+ instead. While the Hero Posse marker is in the last Stage of the Depth Track, ignore all Door/Gate Icons automatically.

#### Dead End Showdowns
Whenever a _Dead End_ Room is found (a Room Map Tile
that has no Exits), roll a D6.

```
1 - Add an **Epic Threat** to the Exploration Token.
2-3 - Add a normal **Threat** to the Exploration Token.
4-6 - There is no extra Threat here.
```

#### Immediate Dread
For this Mission, **_Growing Dread_** cards are revealed immediately when drawn rather than being placed on the stack.

#### Dangerous Escape (Objective)
At the end of any turn in which one or more Heroes is standing on the Mine Entrance Map Tile as the Objective Room, roll a special Hold Back the Darkness test (ignore Depth Events ). If failed, the Darkness marker is not moved, but instead there is an Epic Threat there waiting for you that must be defeated to escape! If the test is successful, the coast is clear and the Heroes are able to hightail it, escaping without incident.

### Objectives

##### Two Dead Ends

When the Heroes find a Dead End Room (a Room with no Exits), after resolving any Encounters or Attacks there, they automatically place one of their Explosives markers on that Map Tile.

If a Room has only Gates as Exits, it also counts as a Dead End (as the Heroes can’t very well plant explosives in another world if they want to collapse the mine here).

The Heroes must place one Explosives marker at a Dead End on the path leading off to the right of the T-Junction and one at a Dead End on the path leading off to the left of the T-Junction. This will ensure that the mine collapses properly.

##### Get Back to the Mine Entrance
Once both Explosives markers are placed, the Heroes must return to the Mine Entrance Map Tile (as the final Objective Room) to escape the blast. This uses the Dangerous Escape Special Rule. Once the Heroes escape (after defeating any Enemies), the Mission is successfully completed.

### Reward
Each Hero receives 25 XP as well as $250 for their efforts.

### Failure

If the Heroes fail the Mission before placing BOTH Explosives , the Darkness escapes the Mine and devours the Heroes Horses before ravaging the countryside. Any Transport Item a Hero has must be discarded ( Horse , Stage Coach , etc.).

If the Heroes fail after placing BOTH Explosives, they are caught in the blast and must each roll once on the Injury Chart to see how bad it is (in addition to any Injury for being KO’d).


# ~City of the Ancients Mission 1 -~ TERROR IN THE NIGHT

```
Last night a massive, lumbering demon emerged from the mines and carried off one of the townsfolk into the hills, leaving a trail of broken and twisted bodies in its wake, as the local lawmen tried to stop it. Now everyone is too afraid to go down into the mines after it...and they should be. The one survivor from the attack gave a description of a massive and brutal creature, unlike any seen before in these parts.
```

### Set Up

This Mission uses the standard set up and all Heroes start on the Mine Entrance Map Tile as normal.

### Mission Goal

The Heroes must hunt down and kill the nightmarish creature, and if possible, rescue the poor victim it carried off into the night. Organizing your Posse for the hunt, you must follow its trail of Clues to find the creature’s lair.

### Special Rules

#### Trail of Clues

Any time the Heroes find a **Clue Icon** on an Exploration Token, they must roll a D6, adding +2 for each Clue they have found. If the total is **8 or higher** , this Room is the final Objective Room.

#### Ultimate Terror

The lumbering creature that the Heroes are hunting is a _Brutal_ **_Night Terror_** (use the red **_Brutal_** side of the Enemy Record Sheet). In addition to being **_Brutal_** , the creature also has the **Tough** ability (Immune to Critical Hits) and gets an extra **+6 Health x The Hero Posse Level** of the group (so if the Hero Posse Level is 4, the Night Terror gets an extra 24 Health, 6 x 4 = 24).

If the Hero Posse Level is 5 or higher, the creature is not just **_Brutal_** (as it would be anyway), but it also gains **all six** of its Elite Chart abilities.

### Objectives

##### The Creature’s Lair

When the Heroes find the Objective Room using the Trail of Clues special rule, they have discovered the Creature’s Lair! Ignore any Attacks or Encounters listed on this Exploration Token. Also, ignore any Door/Gate Icons on the token, as the Objective Room has no exits.

Reveal all Growing Dread cards in the stack as normal and then the Heroes must face the Brutal Night Terror Enemy that they have been hunting for. There is only a single Enemy for this Fight and it is a Night Terror as described in the Ultimate Terror special rule above.

Place a KO’d Hero marker in any space of the final Objective Room to represent the body of the kidnapped victim (models may occupy this space and the body may not be interacted with in any way. It is only for thematic purposes).

Once the Night Terror is defeated, you must discover if the kidnapped victim is still alive. Roll 3D6. If the total is equal to or less than the current position of the Darkness marker on the Depth Track, the victim has been killed; devoured by the Night Terror. Otherwise, they are still alive!

#### Reward

If the Heroes successfully complete the Mission, each Hero gains 50 XP. If the kidnapped person was brought back alive, they also gain D6x$50 each and may draw an additional Loot card.

#### Failure
If the Heroes fail the Mission, each Hero takes D3 Corruption Points , ignoring Willpower, as the loss weighs heavily on their souls.

##### The Rail Barons
```
Rail Barons from back East, like Wilfred F. Peabody of the Atlantica-Pacifco Rail Line, have made their fortunes on the blood, sweat, and tears of folks laying tracks and building bridges all across the Southwest. When Brimstone blew, many of them lost their shirts and moved their operations out of the area. Others doubled- down and started hiring mutant labor to rebuild the lines.
```

##### Working the Cut
```
Rebuilding the rails after the Brimstone explosion has been no easy task. If it’s not swarms of HellBats harrassing the line, it’s Black Fang Indian attacks, or worse. An inspiration to his men, line chief Jackson Montana keeps things moving, despite constant setbacks. Often butting heads with management back East, he gets the job done, not for the money or the glory, but for the men in his charge.
```

# ~City of the Ancients Mission 2 -~ STOP THE RITUAL

```
Rumors have been swirling about a secret cult down in the mines that worship the dark gods of old. The tales tell of human sacrifice and summoning rituals designed to break down the barriers between worlds and bring demonic creatures through. If true, this has to be stopped!
```

### Set Up
This Mission has a **Fixed Map Layout**, as shown in the diagram to the right. The entire board should be constructed during Set Up. There are four open-ended **Objective Doors** on the board; these are the possible locations of the Objective Room. Each Room has a random Exploration Token placed on it, face down (as shown in the diagram).

You will also need the **_Summoning Chamber_** Map Tile and the **Number Counters** marked 1, 2, 3, and 4. Mix these Number Counters up and place one face down, without looking, by each of the **Objective Doors**.

The Heroes start on the **_Mine Entrance_** Map Tile as normal.

### Mission Goal

The Heroes must search the mine to find the location of the **_Summoning Chamber_** and stop the ritual, before it is complete! There are four possible locations for the **_Summoning Chamber_** Room. These are marked on the map diagram with blue arrows.

### Special Rules

#### Fixed Map

This Mission uses a Fixed Map as shown in the Map diagram to the right. A list of all of the Map Tiles used is provided for easier identification. Map Cards can be used as reference to determine the names of each Map Tile.

#### Hero Posse Marker Moves by Stages
In this Mission, the Hero Posse marker is not positioned on the Mine Entrance space of the Depth Track at the start of the game, instead it is placed at the top of the first Stage of the Depth Track. When it is called to do so, move the marker to the top of the next Stage. In this way, the Hero Posse marker moves in large chunks, Stage by Stage, rather than incrementally, space by space.

#### Creature Summoning (Objective)
During the final Fight, any time the Hold Back the Darkness roll is failed, roll a D6. On the roll of 1, 2, or 3, immediately add a Low Threat card to the Fight. These Enemies are placed normally (not in Ambush).

### Objectives

##### Objective Doors
There are four Objective Doors on the board, marked by blue arrows on the Map diagram. After fully completing any Encounters/Attacks on the Exploration Token in a Room with an Objective Door, reveal the face down Number Counter by that Door.

If it is the number ‘ 1 ’, the Heroes have found the Objective Room! Place the Summoning Chamber Map Tile attached to that Objective Door.

If it is any other number, it is blocked off with an End Cap and you must roll a D6. On the roll of 1, 2, or 3, the Hero Posse marker is moved to the next Stage of the Depth Track.

##### Summoning Chamber
Once the Summoning Chamber has been found and attached to the board, the Heroes have reached the Objective Room and the final Fight! Reveal all Growing Dread cards in the stack as normal and then the Heroes must face an Epic Threat that has already been summoned in the Summoning Chamber.

The Creature Summoning special rule is now in effect in the Summoning Chamber until all Enemies have been defeated, putting a stop to the ritual for good.

### Reward
Each Hero receives 50 XP.

### Failure
If the Heroes fail the Mission, the Darkness summoned from the portal escapes the Mines and wreaks havoc on the countryside and the neighboring Towns.

When the Heroes Travel to a Frontier Town before the next Adventure, 2 Random Buildings there will have been Destroyed by the escaping Darkness.

### Map Layout

This Fixed Map layout uses
the following Map Tiles:

Mine:

- Mine Entrance
- Blast Room
- A Rail Tunnel x 2
- A Mining Room
- The Mining Lift
- Cavern of Bones
- Boiler Room
- T-Junction Passage
- Corner Passage
- Mid Passage
- End Cap x 7

# ~City of the Ancients Mission 3 -~ LAST STAND

```
Trapped in the mines, enemies pour in from all sides!
You have but one choice...Fight! Fight for your lives!
There is no escape, only victory, or death. Things have
never looked quite this grim before, but there’s no time to
think about that now...HERE THEY COME!
```

### Set Up

This Mission has a **Fixed Map Layout** , as shown in the diagram to the right. The entire board should be constructed during Set Up. There are four open-ended **Enemy Entry Points** on the board; these are the possible entry points for Enemies to arrive from throughout the game.

You will also need 3 **_Lantern_** markers and several markers for **_Enemies Approaching_** (you can use face down markers with the _Shadows of Brimstone_ logo on the back for these). The Heroes should place the _Lantern_ markers as described in the **_Placed Lanterns_** Special Rule below. For this Mission, there is no **_Old Lantern_** card. The _Lantern_ markers are used instead. Each Hero may start anywhere they choose on the board. Heroes start the Adventure with Grit equal to their Max Grit.

After Heroes are placed, roll a D6 for each of the 4 **Enemy Entry Points** on the board. On the roll of 1, 2, or 3, draw a **Low Threat** card and place those Enemies just off the board near the Entry Point. These Enemies will move onto the board and attack at their Initiative level during the first turn of the game (as detailed in the **_Enemy Entry Points_** Special Rule below).

### Mission Goal

Survive! The Heroes must defeat enough Enemies to break the assault, and then kill any remaining Enemies.

### Special Rules

#### Fixed Map
This Mission uses a Fixed Map as shown in the Map diagram to the right. A list of all of the Map Tiles used is provided for easier identification. Map Cards can be used as reference to determine the names of each Map Tile.

#### Placed Lanterns (3)
At the start of the game, the Heroes may place a number of Lantern markers onto individual Map Tiles. These Lantern markers cannot be interacted with in any way, and are not considered to be in any particular space; a Lantern marker is on an entire Map Tile. Each Lantern marker lights up the Map Tile it is placed on as well as every adjacent Map Tile, just like the Old Lantern card.

#### Desperation
The Heroes are truly desperate. Any Hero that has no Enemies on their Map Tile may give up their Attack to do one of the following Actions instead:

- Scavenge 
- Ready a ‘Once per Fight’ Item
- Recover a Grit 
- Catch Your Breath (Heal D3)

#### Unlimited Scavenging
Each Map Tile on the board may be Scavenged any number of times (not just once per Map Tile).

#### Enemy Entry Points
There are a number of open-ended Enemy Entry Points on the board, marked on the diagram to the right. These are not Doors and may not be looked through by a Hero.

At the end of each turn, roll a D6 for each Entry Point. If a 1 or 2 is rolled (or only on a 1 if there is a Hero on the same Map Tile with the Entry Point), place an Enemies Approaching marker by that Entry Point. You can see Enemies coming, but can’t tell what they are yet!

If there is already an Enemies Approaching marker at that Entry Point, instead, remove the marker and draw a Low Threat card. The Enemies on that card are placed just off the board near that Entry Point, as they have arrived and are ready to move onto the board (note that Enemies that have 0 Move, such as Corpse Piles , will not take part because they cannot move to enter the board).

Enemies that are not on the board yet may not be targeted or attacked in any way. These Enemies will Activate as normal when it comes to their Initiative in the turn order, and will simply move onto the board from the Entry Point (starting their move on one of the puzzle-cut half-spaces).

#### May Not Flee
Once the Adventure begins, the Heroes may not Flee; they are trapped, and must see the Mission through to the end.

#### Immediate Dread
For this Mission, Growing Dread cards are revealed immediately when drawn rather than being placed on the stack.

#### Number of Heroes
For this Mission, if you are using 1 or 2 Heroes, at the start of the game, Threat cards are only drawn for each Entry Point on the D6 roll of 1 (instead of 1, 2, or 3). If you are using 5 or 6 Heroes, all Threat cards drawn are Med Threats instead of Low Threats.

### Objectives

##### Depth Track - Defeat Enough Enemies

Because there is no Exploration in this Mission, the Hero Posse marker on the Depth Track is used a bit differently than normal. Instead of marking how deep into the mine the Heroes have traveled, it marks how much of the Enemy assault the Heroes have defeated.

The Hero Posse marker starts the game on the Mine Entrance space as normal. For every full 3 Enemies the Heroes kill, move the Hero Posse marker down 1 step on the track.

For each Large or bigger Enemy the Heroes kill, instead move the Hero Posse marker 2 steps on the track.

When the Heroes make the Hold Back the Darkness test each turn, if the roll is equal to or higher than the current position of the Hero Posse marker on the Depth Track, the assault is broken! All Enemy Approaching markers are removed, and no more Enemies will arrive at the Entry Points. The Heroes must now kill all remaining Enemies on the board to successfully complete the Mission (including any that might still show up through Darkness cards, etc.).

The Darkness marker on the Depth Track works as normal in this Mission.

### Reward
If the Heroes successfully break the assault and defeat the Enemies, each Hero may draw 5 Loot cards (this is instead of getting a Loot card for each grouping of Enemies individually). Shuffle the Loot Deck before each Hero’s draw. Any Heroes that are not KO’d at the end of the Mission also gain D6x25 XP each.

# Failure
All KO’d Heroes must roll on the Injury/Madness table as
normal. If the Darkness Escapes, any Heroes not KO’d must
still roll on the Injury/Madness table (Hero’s choice).

## This Fixed Map layout uses the following Map Tiles:

Mine:
- Blast Room
- A Rail Tunnel
- A Mining Room
- The Mining Lift
- The Big Room
- Forked Path
- The Vault
- T-Junction Passage
- Corner Passage
- Short Passage
- Mid Passage
- Long Passage
- End Cap x 8

# ~City of the Ancients Mission 4 -~ CITY OF THE ANCIENTS

```
Rumors have been swirling that a mine has been found with a stable gateway leading to a frozen-over alien world, and an ancient, lost city covered in ice! There are stories of untold riches there and mechanical devices of super-science, beyond anything anybody has ever seen. Of course, there are also tales of hideous monsters and massive automatons that stalk the cold corridors of the crumbling city. But those are all just rumors...right?
```

### Set Up
This Mission uses the standard set up and all Heroes start on the **_Mine Entrance_** Map Tile as normal.

### Mission Goal
Find a Gate that leads to the ancient alien city of the _Targa Plateau_ and explore the city. Once in the **_Targa Plateau_** , the Heroes must find 2 Clue Icons to have explored the city and successfully completed the Mission.

### Special Rules

#### All Gates Lead to Targa

All Gates in this Adventure lead to the **_Targa Plateau_** , even Gates found in the Targa Plateau (they lead to a different part of the city).

#### Mine Clues add a Gate

Any **Clue Icon** the Heroes find in the Mines, automatically has a Gate in that Room, in addition to any other doors (place this Gate before other Doors).

### Objectives

##### The Second Clue in Targa

When the Heroes find the second **Clue Icon** in the **_Targa Plateau_** , they have reached the Objective for exploring this Other World. Ignore any **_Attacks_** or **_Encounters_** listed on the final Exploration Token. Also, ignore any Door/Gate Icons on the token, as the Objective Room has no exits.

Reveal all **Growing Dread** cards in the stack as normal and then the Heroes must face an **Epic Threat**. Remember, that any time a normal Threat card (Low, Med, or High) would be drawn in an Other World, an **_Other World Threat_** card is drawn instead. Once all Enemies have been defeated, the Heroes have successfully completed the Mission!

### Reward
Each Hero gains 25 XP and recovers enough trinkets and bits of broken alien tech that they can sell for D6x$50.

### Failure
As the Heroes have failed to explore enough of Targa to get their bearings, they are caught off guard by an icy blizzard outside the more secluded sections of the city. Each Hero takes D6 Wounds, ignoring Defense, that carry over to the next Adventure.

# ~City of the Ancients Mission 5 -~ FROZEN EXPEDITION

```
While exploring the ancient, frozen ruins of the Targa Plateau, you have accidentally tripped some sort of chain reaction. The ancient boilers in this part of the city are overloading and set to blow! Echoing through the halls, you hear a recorded alien voice that can only be a warning of the imminent melt-down to come, and a countdown to destruction!
```

### Set Up
This Mission starts on the **Targa Plateau** side of the **Mine Entrance** Map Tile. Other than beginning the game in the _Targa Plateau_ , all Heroes start on the **_Mine Entrance_** Map Tile as normal.

You will also need the **_Engineering Chamber_** Targa Map Tile. Remove the **_Engineering Chamber_** Map Card from the **Targa Map Deck**.

### Mission Goal
The Heroes must find the **_Engineering Chamber_** and shut down the Boilers before this section of the city explodes. The Heroes must find **2 Clue Icons** to discover the location of the **_Engineering Chamber_** Objective room and shut down all 3 of the Boilers there.

### Special Rules

**No Gates**
No **Gates** can be found in this Mission. Any time a Gate would be placed, instead place a normal Door.

#### Targa Pylons Activated

The Targa defense systems have been activated! All **Passage** Map Tiles the Heroes find automatically have **D3-1** **_Targa Pylon_** Enemies on them as an Attack! When a **Passage** Map Tile is placed with 1 or more **_Targa Pylons_** on it, the turn immediately ends and a new turn begins as a Fight. No **Loot** card is drawn for defeating these defensive **_Targa Pylons_**.

#### Hard to Hold Back the Darkness

The **Hold Back the Darkness** roll needs to be one higher than normal to succeed each turn.

#### Void Cascade and Warning Sirens

While the Darkness marker is in the middle Stage of the Depth Track, every Hero takes **1 Horror Hit** at the start of their Activation, due to the wailing sirens and waves of Void energy pouring through the halls. While the Darkness marker is in the final Stage of the Depth Track, every Hero takes **2 Horror Hits** instead.

#### May Not Flee
Once the Adventure begins, the Heroes
may not Flee; they are trapped, and must see the
Mission through to the end.

### Objectives

##### The Second Clue

When the Heroes discover the second Clue Icon, they have found the Door leading to the Objective Room. Ignore any Door/Gate Icons on the Exploration Token, as there is only one exit from this room (roll for Door position as normal). Resolve any Encounters or Attacks on this Exploration Token.

Once all Encounters and Attacks have been resolved here, attach the Engineering Chamber Map Tile to the final Door as the Objective Room.

##### Engineering Chamber

Once the Engineering Chamber has been attached to the board, the Heroes have reached the Objective Room and the final Fight! Reveal all Growing Dread cards in the stack as normal and then the Heroes must face an Epic Threat that has been attracted to the area by the surges of Void energy from the overcharged Boilers.

There are 4 spaces at the far end of the Room that contain the Boilers. Any Hero in one of these spaces may give up their Attack to make a Strength 6+ or Cunning 5+ test to shut down one of the Boilers. If successful, gain 20 XP and place a marker to show that one of the Boilers is shut down. Once all 3 Boilers are Shut Down, the Hard to Hold Back the Darkness and Void Cascade and Warning Sirens Special Rules are no longer in effect.

To successfully complete the Mission, the Heroes must defeat all Enemies and shut down all 3 Boilers.

### Reward
Each Hero gains 50 XP and rolls a D6. On the roll of 3+, draw a Targa Artifact.

### Failure

If the Mission is failed, the Boilers explode! All Heroes must roll once on the Injury Table. This is in addition to any roll that must be made for having been KO’d.

# ~City of the Ancients Mission 6 -~ 

A recent expedition to the Targa Plateau brought back a small collection of ancient, frozen creatures to study. But they have begun to wake up... and attack! The expedition’s notes were lost and scattered when the group was attacked in the Other World, but those journal pages may hold the key of how to stop these creatures before the whole town is destroyed!

### Set Up

This Mission starts with the **Mine Entrance** Map Tile leading directly to a **_Gate End Cap_**. All Heroes start on the **_Mine Entrance_** Map Tile as normal.

### Mission Goal

The Heroes must find and collect **5 Lost Journal Pages** to get enough information to stop the creatures. Every **Clue Icon** found represents **D3 Lost Journal Pages** in that Room. Once any Encounters or Attacks on the Exploration Token have been fully resolved, those **Lost Journal Pages** are collected. The Heroes must then get back to Town to help stop the creatures!

### Special Rules

**All Gates Lead to Targa**

All Gates in this Adventure lead to the **_Targa Plateau_** , even Gates found in the Targa Plateau (they lead to a different part of the city).

### Objectives

**The Final Journal Pages**

When the Heroes discover the Clue Icon with the last Journal Pages they need (enough to give them at least 5 Journal Pages total), they have found the Objective Room where the original expedition had been attacked!

Ignore any **_Attacks_** or **_Encounters_** listed on the final Exploration Token. Also, ignore any Door/Gate Icons on the token, as the Objective Room has no exits.

Reveal all **Growing Dread** cards in the stack as normal and then the Heroes must face an **Epic Threat**. Once all Enemies have been defeated, the Heroes collect the final Lost Journal Pages they need and must return to the Town to help stop the creatures and complete the Mission!

##### Back to Town

Once the Heroes have collected enough Lost Journal Pages, the Adventure ends, but the Mission continues. The Heroes must Travel back to Town, as they normally would between Adventures.

Once in Town, before doing anything else, each Hero must make a Lore 5+ test to help stop the creatures. Gain 10 XP for each 5+ rolled. For each Hero that fails the test, one Random Building in Town is Destroyed before the creatures can be stopped.

### Reward
Each Hero gains 50 XP. They also gain $250 if no buildings were destroyed.

### Failure
If the Mission is failed, the Heroes do not get back in time to save the Town and it is overrun and destroyed by the creatures. The Heroes may not visit a Frontier Town after the Adventure, but instead must proceed directly on to the next Adventure.

Each Hero also takes D3 Corruption Hits from the sight of the mangled remains of the Town they failed to save.


# TRAVELING TO TOWN

When keeping your Heroes from game to game in a campaign, it is important to be able to resupply and get pesky Injuries, Madness, or Mutations Healed. To do this, Heroes can Travel across the countryside to reach a Frontier Town. Traveling in the shadows of the Brimstone cataclysm can be a dangerous prospect, even for the most hearty of Heroes, so beware.

### Resetting Heroes for Travel and Town

As noted in the _Campaign Play_ section of the Rule Book on page 36, there are a series of steps the Heroes go through at the End of Each Adventure. This represents the Heroes regrouping outside the Mines.

```
As noted, every Hero is reset to full Health, full Sanity, and 1 Grit before Traveling to visit a Frontier Town.
```

### Mission Success or Failure

The success or failure of the previous Mission can have an impact on your Traveling or the Town you visit, as noted in the individual Mission just played. Oftentimes, failing a Mission will lead to one or more Locations in Town being Destroyed by the Darkness that you let Escape from the local mines.

### Preparing to Travel

Once the Heroes are ready to Travel, every Hero in the Posse must roll a D6.

```
A Hero that rolls a 1 or 2 on the die adds a Travel Hazard to the journey.
```

### Rolling for Travel Hazards

Once you have established how many Travel Hazards there will be, each Hero that added a Hazard to the trip must roll once on the Travel Hazard Chart. This can be done in any order, but each Travel Hazard roll must be completed before the next roll on the chart is made.

Note that Travel Hazards usually affect the whole group, but on occasion, they will specifically affect the Hero that triggered the Hazard/rolled the result on the chart.

The Travel Hazard Chart can be found at the back of this book, on page 56.

To roll on the chart, a Hero rolls 3D6 and adds them together. The result (between 3 and 18) is then consulted on the chart to see what the Heroes have encountered in their Travels.

### Completing Your Travels

Once all of the Travel Hazards are rolled for and resolved (and there may not have been any at all, if none of the Heroes rolled a 1 or 2 on their Travel die), the Heroes have reached their destination. Arriving at a Frontier Town, the Heroes may now interact with that Town, as described below.

### Horses and the Stage Coach

One thing that Heroes can buy while in Town is a specialty Transport, in the form of a Horse or a Stage Coach. It is assumed that every Hero has a basic Horse that lets them Travel between the mines and towns, and is left outside when delving down into the mines for an Adventure. This basic Horse does not give any bonuses and cannot be Upgraded in any way (with Dark Stone Horse Shoes, etc). Buying a specialized Horse or a Stage Coach for the Posse gives you bonuses for Traveling. These can be found at the Blacksmith in Town.

As the Stage Coach is an Item used by the whole Posse, it is limited to One per Hero Posse , as noted in its store entry. It is still purchased by a single Hero and they are considered the owner of it (or driver). The Heroes may pool their Gold, of course, to help pay for it though, as it is an expensive purchase.

# VISITING A FRONTIER TOWN

Once the Heroes have completed their Traveling, they reach a Frontier Town in which to buy supplies and equipment, as well as to try to Heal Injuries or Madness, or even get Corruption and Mutations removed. Of course, just because you are in a Town, it does not mean that you are safe. This is the Old West after all, and there are always dark forces at play.

## THE TOWN BOARD

The Town is represented by a small board that shows the various **Locations** you can visit as well as the **Hotel** or **Camp Site** you will be staying in. It also has a **Town Event Track** to show how long the Heroes have been in Town since the last Event occurred.

### Setting up the Town Board

The Town Board is printed on the back side of the Depth Event Chart and should be laid out at the center of the table where all Players can reach it. Place the Hero Posse marker on the ‘1’ space of the **Town Event Track**.

### The Town Event Track

At the end of each Day in Town, the Heroes will have to make a single roll to see if a Town Event has occurred. These are usually fairly bad things and best to be avoided. The more Days that have passed since the last Town Event, the more likely it is that one will happen, so staying in Town for too long can get a bit risky. Rolling for Town Events and the Town Event Chart can be found on the large Frontier Town reference sheet.

### Town Locations

There are 6 Locations that the Heroes can visit while in Town - the **_Doc’s Office_** , **_Blacksmith_** , **_Saloon_** , **_Frontier Outpost_** , **_Church_** , and **_General Store_**. Each Location has Items that you can purchase as well as a unique Event Chart and specialty services. They are also each represented by a large, double- sided reference sheet that can be passed around the table as Heroes visit the different Locations.

### Random Town Locations

Sometimes determining a **Random Town Location** will be required. When this happens, simply roll a D6 and consult the numbers in the bottom corner of each of the Location spaces on the Town Board. Note that the Hotel and Camp Site are not numbered and will never be selected Randomly like this.

### Destroyed Town Locations

Sometimes one or more Town Locations will be **Destroyed**. When this happens, place a marker on that Location to show that Heroes may not visit it for the rest of this Town Stay.

## A DAY IN TOWN

```
Saxton’s Fancy Tonic

Roaming the countryside in his wagon
of elixirs and miracle cures, Alfred Saxton III,
Esquire peddles his wares and tonics to all weary
travelers. Why, for nary the cost of a bottle of fine
whiskey, you can purchase yourself an all-in-one
tonic to cure your ailing health. But don’t delay,
act now! He’ll be off in a cloud of dust before
you can count your change.
```

### The Hotel and the Camp Site

At the start of each Day in Town, each Hero must decide if they want to stay at the **Hotel** for the cost of $10, or if they would rather stay at the Camp Site for Free. Players should place their Hero on the Town Board in either the Hotel or Camp Site space.

Though the Camp Site does not cost Gold to stay at, it can be a little rough. Any Hero staying at the Camp Site must roll 2D6 on the Camp Site Hazard Chart to see if anything happens. This Chart can be found on the large Frontier Town reference sheet. Heroes staying at the Hotel simply pay their $10 for the Day.

### Visiting a Town Location

Each Hero is allowed to visit one Town Location a Day. All of the Heroes should move their figure to the Location space on the Town Map that they wish to visit for the Day.

### Location Event Charts

Once all of the Heroes are at the Location they have chosen for the Day, each Hero must roll 2D6 on the Location Event Chart for the Location they are visiting. These charts can be found on the individual large reference sheets for the different Locations.

Very often a Location Event Chart result will affect all of the Heroes at that Location for the Day.

### Buying Equipment and Services

Once all of the Location Events have been rolled for and resolved, Heroes may purchase Items and pay for special services at the Location they are visiting.

The cost for each Item or service is listed on the Location’s reference sheet. When a Hero spends Gold to pay for an Item or service, the amount is deducted from that Hero’s Gold total (just like in real life). Gold can sometimes be hard to come by though, so spend it wisely (again, just like in real life).

### Selling Dark Stone

Dark Stone may also be sold, but only to the Outpost Bank located at the Frontier Outpost Location. Details for this can be found on the Location’s reference sheet.

### Selling Items

While in Town, a Hero may elect to sell any Item card
they have for the amount of Gold listed in the bottom right
corner of the card. Discard the card and add the Gold value to
your Hero. This can be done at any time, regardless of where
in Town you are.

Items purchased in Town may also be sold later for 50%
of the value you paid to get the Item. Services, of course, may
not be sold as they were a one time event that you paid for.

### Hero Starting Gear

Heroes may NOT trade or give their Starting Items to other Heroes, and may NOT choose to sell their Starting Items in Town.

When called on to discard an Item (by an event or Travel Hazard, for instance), a Hero may NOT choose to discard a Starting Item (though a Starting Item MAY be lost when discarding a ‘Random Item’).

A Starting Item MAY be discarded voluntarily, to make room for carrying other Items.

Because Starting Gear cards are a fundamental part of every Hero Class, if a Hero’s Starting Item has been lost/ discarded, they MAY purchase a replacement of it in Town, at any time (no specific Location is required), for the Gold Value listed on that Item. If there is no Gold Value listed, the Hero may acquire a replacement for free.

## FORGING DARK STONE

One of the special services provided at the **_Blacksmith_** Location (as well as some other Locations in Town) is to **Forge** Dark Stone into powerful Items, or Upgrades that can be attached to an Item to improve its abilities.

To have your Dark Stone Forged into an Item or an Upgrade, you simply pick the entry you would like to get and pay the costs shown in both Gold and Dark Stone.

### Forging Upgrades

Dark Stone **Forged** Upgrades work just like Upgrade cards found on an Adventure (as described in the Rulebook on page 21), with one notable exception - Forged Upgrades are permanently attached to an Item and cannot be removed or sold separately from that Item.

The amount of Upgrade Slots that a Forged Upgrade requires is listed on each entry as well as if it adds one or more Dark Stone Icons to the Item. Forging several Upgrades onto an Item can greatly improve that Item, but can also make it a little dangerous. At the end of a game, when rolling for Dark Stone Corruption, a Hero must roll for EACH Dark Stone Icon on the Items they are carrying. This means the more you enhance an Item with Dark Stone, the more Corruption it will cause you over time.

## END OF THE DAY

Once all of the Heroes have finished their Location visit,
the Day ends and the Heroes must roll to see if a Town Event
occurs. If it does, the Town Event must be resolved and affects
all Heroes in Town. If not, then the Day ends quietly with a
nice sunset over the mountains.
Then, a new Day begins and the process is repeated.

### Leaving Town

Any Heroes that do not want to spend any more time in
Town may elect to Leave Town at the end of a Day, after the
Town Event is rolled for and resolved. Once a Hero Leaves
Town, they may not return until after the next Adventure, but
are no longer affected by any Town Events that may occur.

Master of the Forge

When Dark Stone was first discovered, it was said to be too unstable and too brittle to use in forging. But that didn’t stop blacksmith and artisan Leo Blake from trying his hand at it. With some frontier ingenuity, he was soon able to start melting, refining, and forging the stuff. His methods unlocked the Dark Stone’s full potential and he became famous overnight. No one has more experience forging Dark Stone, and his creations are highly sought after.

```
Dead or Alive

Countless bandidos from south of the border have traveled up to the area around Brimstone to get in on the action and make their fortune; many as outlaws and thugs. One infamous bandido is Carlos Rodriguez de Salvo, also known as ‘El Tejon’, The Badger. He has robbed more stage coaches, banks, and trains than most other bandidos combined, and is as ruthless as he is tenacious.
```

```
High Noon

Since the fall of Brimstone, more Gunslingers have
come ‘round these parts than ever. From all walks of
life and all different reasons, men and women alike
have come to test their mettle against the Darkness that
resides here...and of course against each other. Vera
Strong is one such Gunfighter. Often underestimated for
her size, she carves a notch in her holster for
every man she’s killed in a duel. Recently, she
had to get a second holster.

# HERO CLASSES AND LEVELING UP

There are several different Hero Classes that players can choose from in Shadows of Brimstone, each with their own style of play and unique feel. Keeping your Hero from game to game allows them to progress in Hero Level, gaining new abilities and collecting all manner of Gear and Artifacts along the way to help in their Adventures against tougher and tougher Enemies.

## XP AND HERO LEVELS

Once your Hero has collected enough XP, you can spend it to go up to the next Hero Level. This will usually grant you more Health/Sanity, Skill boosts, and even a new Ability unique to your Hero Class.

### Spending XP to Level Up

The amount of XP required to ‘Level Up’ to the next Hero Level is shown on the chart below.


| Hero Level | XP Cost |
|:----------:|:-------:|
|     1      |  Start  |
|    1->2    |   500   |
|    2->3    |  1,000  |
|    3->4    |  2,000  |
|    4->5    |  3,000  |
|    5->6    |  4,500  |
|    6->7    |  6,000  |
|    7->8    |  8,000  |


```
It is important to note that XP is actually
spent to Level Up, removing the XP from your
Hero’s XP total.
```
### Mark Down Your New Level
Once you have spent the required XP to Level Up, make a note of your new Hero Level to keep track of where you are.

### Hero Level Cap

Heroes max out at Level 8. Though you can continue to acquire XP and keep Adventuring, you may not Level Up beyond Hero Level 8 (at least not yet).

### Leveling Up Mid-Game

As soon as a Hero has enough XP, they may spend that XP to Level Up. This may even be done during an Adventure! A Hero may Level Up at the start of a Game Turn by spending the appropriate amount of XP. That Hero immediately Fully Heals their Health and Sanity, and Recovers 1 Grit. They may then immediately gain the benefits of Leveling Up as noted below

```
A Hero that has enough XP to Level Up
MUST do so before the next Adventure begins.
```

### Roll for Free Upgrade Bonus

Each Hero Class has a free Upgrade Bonus Chart. Whenever your Hero Levels Up, you get to roll 2D6 on the Chart to determine your random bonus. This is in addition to choosing a new Ability for your Hero.

## Choosing an Upgrade Chart Ability

Every Hero Class also has an Upgrade Chart that acts as a skill tree of new abilities, unique to your Hero Class. Each time you Level Up, you may choose one new Ability from your Upgrade Chart.

The chart has four different vertical Tracks that run top to bottom and are themed for a particular aspect of that Hero Class. When choosing a new Ability, you may pick from any of the four Tracks, but you must take the first Ability in that Track that you do not already have. In other words, you must have the first tier Ability in a Track before you can take the second tier ability below it, etc. Note that as the Hero Level cap is 8, a Hero will not be able to get the fourth tier ability in more than one of the different Tracks, so choose wisely as you Level Up.

## HERO POSSE LEVEL

Just like each individual Hero has a Hero Level, the group as a whole has a Hero Posse Level. The Hero Posse Level is equal to the highest Level Hero currently in the group, so a group with a Level 2 Hero, two Level 3 Heroes, and a Level 4 Hero would be Hero Posse Level 4.

The Hero Posse Level is set at the start of each Adventure and allows for different Heroes to come and go from the group from game to game. Once an Adventure starts, the Hero Posse Level does NOT change, even if one or more Heroes Level Up mid-game.

### Tougher Monsters

As the Heroes go up in Level, the Enemies that you fight will also naturally get more difficult. All of the Enemies in an Adventure get a Bonus based on the Hero Posse Level at the start of that Adventure as follows:

| Posse Level | Enemy Bonus                |
|:-----------:|:--------------------------:|
|      1      | No Bonus                   |
|      2      | No Bonus                   |
|      3      | 1 Elite Ability            |
|      4      | 2 Elite Abilities          |
|      5      | Brutal Side of Enemies     |
|      6      | Brutal Side of Enemies     |
|      7      | Brutal + 1 Elite Ability   |
|      8      | Brutal + 2 Elite Abilities |

```
Remember also that Elite Enemies are +5XP
for each Elite Ability they have. Brutal Enemies
are worth more XP as listed on their sheet.
```

# U.S. MARSHAL

U.S. Marshals are ‘tough as nails’ bounty hunters, working for the government. No stranger to working alone, they travel the land looking for those who need a little justice. When the need arises though, they step up to lead those around them, descending into the very depths of hell if necessary to get the job done.

### Playing a U.S. Marshal

U.S. Marshals are one of the toughest Hero Classes in the game. With a Defense 3+, they can easily be a frontline fighter, blocking a hall or wading into groups of Enemies, shrugging off most incoming Attacks. With their Shotgun and _Double- Shot_ ability, a U.S. Marshal can also deal out large amounts of damage as a virtual one man army. The Marshal’s Badge makes them a solid team player, waiting until just the right time to flash the Badge and give every Hero a boost to their next Attack!

### Starting Upgrade Choices

U.S. Marshal Starting Upgrades focus on Recovering Grit,
gaining extra XP, and Healing.

#### Rolling Thunder

This ability is great for offsetting the potential ‘feast or famine’ of only getting to roll a single Shot each turn with the Shotgun. It is fantastic for making sure you always have the Grit you need to Re-roll dice and to activate your more powerful abilities as you level up.

#### Cleaning Up the West

By Cleaning Up the West, you can make sure that you are always Healing a little bit of Health and Sanity as you fight, helping you to stay alive while getting up close and personal with your Shotgun. It also gives you a boost to Max Grit and XP, giving you a leg up on Leveling Up, especially early on in your Hero’s career.

#### Hardened Resolve

To focus on a more team leader style role, Hardened Resolve gives you a solid ability to Heal yourself and the rest of the posse, even at a distance. It also makes Tonic Tokens you bring along in your Side Bag far more effective.

### Leveling Up a U.S. Marshal

Whenever you go up to a new Hero Level, roll 2D6 on the following chart for your free Upgrade Bonus. You may also choose one new Ability from the U.S. Marshal Upgrade Chart on the next page (as detailed above in the section on Leveling Up a Hero ).

| 2D6 Roll | Upgrade Bonus                                                                                                                                |
|:--------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|

|     3    | On the Trail - Start each Adventure and Travel/Town with 1 extra Grit.                                                                       |

|     9    | +1 Side Bag Token Capacity. Also, gain +D6 Health/Sanity (any mix)                                                                           |
|    10    | +2 Corruption Resistance                                                                                                                     |

# SALOON GIRL

Saloon Girls dance, sing, and perform while in town, but use those same skills to dodge, leap, and kick when it comes to fighting down in the mines. Sassy and full of moxie, a Saloon Girl is just as good at using her charms to keep the posse going as she is at fighting dirty.

### Playing a Saloon Girl

Saloon Girls (and male Piano Players) are extremely agile and fast moving. This gives them the edge in dodging Enemy Attacks and getting where they need to go, but leaves something to be desired when it comes to absorbing damage. Be careful to not get yourself surrounded, or you may find yourself on the wrong side of a tentacle!

With built-in Healing, Saloon Girls are good at moving amongst the group and reinvigorating the party, and the **_Hold-Out Pistol_** is a solid Free Attack that can be used every Fight.

#### Starting Upgrade Choices
Saloon Girl Starting Upgrades focus on doing extra damage, avoiding damage, and freedom of movement.

#### Dirty Fightin’
This ability is great for giving all of your Attacks that extra little bit that so often is all it takes to finish off an Enemy.

It’s not as directly powerful as Knockout Punch , but it doesn’t require Grit to use and is always in effect.

#### Knockout Punch

This ability gives you the potential to capitalize on lucky Critical Hits by doubling the damage that you can dish out when you need to. Requiring Grit though, means that you may not be able to use it as often as the other two Upgrades.

#### Acrobatic Dodge
Going the acrobatic route allows you to have unparalleled freedom of movement and gives you extra ability to survive if you get in a tight spot. Being light on your feet, however, reduces the potential for dealing damage that the other Upgrades give you.

### Leveling Up a Saloon Girl

Whenever you go up to a new Hero Level, roll 2D6 on the following chart for your free Upgrade Bonus. You may also choose one new Ability from the Saloon Girl Upgrade Chart on the next page (as detailed above in the section on Leveling Up a Hero ).

| 2D6 Roll | Upgrade Bonus                                                                                                                                |

|    9     | +2 Corruption Resistance                                                                                                                     |

|   11     | +1 Initiative                                                                                                                                |
|   12     | The Look - Once per turn, you may Heal 1 extra Wound or Sanity from a single adjacent Hero with your Comforting Presence.                    |

# BANDIDO

With a healthy mix of stubbornness, a raging temper, and a lust for life, Bandidos are unpredictable to say the least. Between blasting away at everything in sight with a hail of bullets and casually tossing dynamite across the room, there’s never a dull moment when a Bandido is in the group!

### Playing a Bandido
Bandidos are truly a wild card in that they can be played in so many different ways. Their built-in ability to recover Grit mixed with a low Ranged To Hit value means that the Bandido tends to roll a lot of dice, and then Re-roll a lot of dice just to blow things up. This gives them a lot of swing in luck, but makes for a fun adventure! It also means that they rarely have a shortage of Grit for activating abilities or using more powerful Grit-based Items they find along the way.

### Starting Upgrade Choices

The Bandido Starting Upgrades each focus on a completely different aspect of the character and vastly change how he feels to play.

#### Twin Guns
This ability is ideal if you want to roll a lot of dice! With two Pistols, the Bandido can unleash a serious Barrage, even if he doesn’t hit much. But hey, that’s what Grit is for. It also compensates for a low Ranged To Hit value by getting more dice and more potential Critical Hits.

#### Explosives Expert
The ability to create Dynamite Tokens using Grit allows the Bandido to blow up anything in sight (though sometimes this includes the other Heroes too, or even himself). The added bonus of starting with the Dynamite Satchel allows you to hold an abundance of explosives as well.

#### Swindler
Focusing more on collecting Loot and hand-to-hand, this ability shifts the Bandido into a strong Melee fighter. This circumvents your low Ranged To Hit value by simply encouraging you to get up close and personal.

### Leveling Up a Bandido
Whenever you go up to a new Hero Level, roll 2D6 on the following chart for your free Upgrade Bonus. You may also choose one new Ability from the Bandido Upgrade Chart on the next page (as detailed above in the section on Leveling Up a Hero ).

| 2D6 Roll | Upgrade Bonus                                                                                                                               |

# GUNSLINGER

Perhaps the most classic Old West archetype is the Gunslinger. Fast on the draw, and deadly with a pistol, Gunslingers are the best shots in the West, though often they are more frail and gaunt than the more hearty, frontier folk. Living a fast life full of drinking and gambling, a Gunslinger knows that life is short and unforgiving; the only way to survive is to kill them before they kill you.

### Playing a Gunslinger
Gunslingers are one of the best Classes for sheer amount of Damage they can deal out. They are also the fastest Class in the game! Of course this comes at a price in that they do not have a lot of Health or Defense, and even as they go up in Hero Level, they are slow to earn more Health. This can be compensated for a bit with _Clothing_ Items that add Health.

### Starting Upgrade Choices
Gunslinger Starting Upgrades focus on getting extra shots with a Gun or being able to reload your Six-Shooter.

#### Pistol Fanning
This ability allows you to **double** the base number of  Shots listed on a **Gun** card (note that this only doubles the printed number, not any additional Shots granted by Upgrades, abilities, or anything else).

#### Quickdraw
Quickdraw lets you get the upper hand, even when Enemies attack from Ambush. This can be a great way to keep yourself alive by killing Enemies before they get to attack you - Kill or be killed!

#### Reload
This is the only way for a Gunslinger to get more Shots into his Six-Shooter Template during an Adventure. Reload may re-fill any Types of Shots available to you, back into your Six-Shooter Template, though no more of a particular Type than you are allowed to start an Adventure with, and no more than 6 Shots total. This is regardless of what was previously loaded.

### Leveling Up a Gunslinger
Whenever you go up to a new Hero Level, roll 2D6 on the following chart for your free Upgrade Bonus. You may also choose one new Ability from the Gunslinger Upgrade Chart on the next page (as detailed above in the section on Leveling Up a Hero ).

| 2D6 Roll | Upgrade Bonus                                                                                                                                |

# Shadows of Brimstone - City of the Ancients

This Revised Edition of **Shadows of Brimstone™**  features all new plastic miniatures that are easy-  to-assemble with fantastic detail! From concept to  sculpture, it has always been important to us that the  poses are dynamic and exciting, and that  their features are characterful.

The figures in this gallery were painted by award-winning, Flying Frog Productions Studio painter, Aaron Lovejoy. His beautiful paintjobs have been part of Shadows of Brimstone from the beginning!

Bandido - Hero

Saloon Girl - Hero

Gunslinger - Hero

U.S. Marshal - Hero

Night Terror - Large-Sized Demon Enemy

Void Spiders - Void Beast Enemies

Stranglers - Demon Enemies

Tentacles - Void Enemies

Goliath - XL-Sized Demon Enemy

The gargantuan Goliath model towers over the other figures in the City of the Ancients™ Core Set. From the beginning of development, one of our goals was to have enemies of different sizes and we wanted one creature to be a huge Epic Enemy! The new model has sharp detail and a new “base topper” with sculpted detail of rocks, mine debris, and shards of Dark Stone!

# ENEMY OVERVIEW

### Void Spiders

Inhabiting the space between the Void and reality, these scurrying beasts infest virtually every world that portals open into. With six segmented, spiny legs and two large mandible claw arms, Void Spiders can scale any surface and are often found nesting on the walls and ceilings, as well as the floor.

On the underside of the creature is a large mouth, lined with jagged teeth and articulated jaws within the body of the beast. Void Spiders primary form of attack is to lunge at their prey and get on top of them, using these under mouths to chomp and tear at their victims. Many Void Spiders secrete a Void Venom, paralyzing their target before cocooning them in sticky webs to feed upon slowly.


### Stranglers

Vicious, headless demons with an array of squirming tentacle arms and claws, Stranglers stand just short the height of a man. Often hunched over, they use their arms as well as their legs to move, charging at their targets with demonic speed.

Ensnaring a foe with its powerful tentacles allows the Strangler to draw them in to its gaping maw. Ringed with sharp teeth, the massive mouth of the Strangler is inset into its torso, allowing the creature to bite down on entire arms and even the heads of its victims.

### Tentacles

Bursting through the ground or up out of the water, these enormous writhing tentacles lash about, smashing anything in their path. Straight from the Void, it is unclear as to whether these appendages operate on their own or are part of a much larger creature below the surface.

Two rows of vicious suckers line the underside of each tentacle, gripping and pulsing as they undulate overhead. Waiting for the moment to wrap themselves around their victims and pull them screaming into the darkness!

### Night Terrors

Standing nearly ten feet tall, the Night Terror is a hideous demon with sunken glowing eyes, a grotesquely wide mouth, lined with razor sharp teeth, and covered in dark blue fur and rocky skin. Often found roaming the icy halls of the long dead cities of the Targa Plateau, the Night Terror’s dark and thick fur allows it to move unseen in the shadows. Its clawed hands can rend a man limb-from-limb in a single sweep of its mighty arms, yet it often prefers to grab hold of unwary explorers and steal away with them into the dark night!

Where it takes the unlucky victims is unknown, but it is rare that any have escaped the clutches and lived to tell the tale. Many times the only indication of the presence of a Night Terror is the faint menace of its gurgling and hissing in the dark, the likes of which will causes a chill to the bone on a primitive level of sheer terror.


### Goliath

With a gigantic muscular body and horrendously long, flailing tentacle arms, the Goliath is an unspeakable horror like no other. Its bellowing roar and dripping mass of tentacle tongues consume all that stray within reach, smashing, crushing, and devouring the souls of those who would dare stand before it.

But perhaps the most frightening aspect of the Goliath is the cold intelligence clearly visible behind its multitude of soulless black eyes. It knows you’re here...it knows why you’ve come...and it knows you have made a terrible mistake.


### Targa Pylons

Throughout the city of the Ancients, on the Targa Plateau, stand a series of tall, Dark Stone Pylons. Re-activated after countless eons as a defensive measure, these Pylons power up with a low hum of energy resonating through their master-crafted stonework. Atop each Pylon is a laser eye, ready to fire searing blasts of super-heated plasma at any invaders or unwelcome guests of the city.

Though Targa Pylons are immobile, they have the ability to fire their defensive lasers in all directions. This makes them difficult to approach, and virtually impossible to sneak up on. Frequently found in pairs, these Pylons stand watch as silent sentries left behind to watch over the once great city.


# **OTHER WORLD - THE TARGA PLATEAU**

The Targa Plateau is a distant alien world across the unfathomable reaches of space. Once the home to a great alien civilization of advanced Ancients, it is now long dead and abandoned, frozen over in an eternal winter and crumbling under the extreme weight of the ages. Though its inhabitants are long gone, there are many creatures and beings that have moved in, infesting the darker halls and corners of the expansive frozen cityscape.

### **A Frozen World**

Falling into an ice age as its distant star cooled, the ancient city at the heart of the Targa Plateau is cold and desolate. Blizzards rage with whipping winds, and massive crystals of ice collect at the base of every structure. Some areas of the city are completely encased in glaciers, while others have had their footings eroded, collapsing into massive lakes of icy water and sinking into the deep unknown.

Snowfall is a constant, but the levels of wind and cold ebb and flow with the dark and frigid weather patterns around the planet. When the storms are at their worst, they could freeze a man solid in the blink of an eye. Avalanches and falling icicles are also an ever-present and terrifying threat from above, and can be set off with the smallest of disturbances.

Tidally locked with its star, the Targa Plateau is in a perpetual state of twilight as the light of the faded sun breaks through the thick cloud cover overhead. The other side of the planet is in perpetual shadow. It remains a mystery as  no known gates have ever opened there and any would- be explorers would surely freeze long before reaching the horizon.

### Ancient Alien City

A massive sprawling city covers the twilight surface of the Targa Plateau. Full of courtyards and monolithic statuary, the city’s exterior must have once been breathtaking in its day. Now frozen and glassy with ice, the statues and buildings crumble and topple, as the freezing and thawing over eons reduces the stone to rubble.

Most of the halls and buildings still stand, a testament to the architectural wonder of the ancient beings that created them. There are even boilers and technological systems still running, and the orange glow of the geothermal energy can be found throughout the city’s long abandoned rooms and passages.

### Caretakers

The legacy of the Ancients is still felt throughout the city as robotic Custodians roam the halls repairing the systems and keeping everything in working order. The city is also watched over by ancient Pylons, powered by Dark Stone and activated in times of danger. But perhaps the most fearsome achievement of the Ancients is the Guardians. These gargantuan robot protectors vary in size and style and reside in alcoves throughout Targa, waking when the city is threatened to crush any that would dare disturb their robotic slumber.


# 

##### **Sheriff of Brimstone**

_When things started getting out of hand in Brimstone, Sheriff Adrian Meyers objected to the influx of mining companies and greedy prospectors overworking the hills. He tried to put a stop to it, but was fired for his efforts and left town just weeks before the whole place exploded. The last man from Brimstone, the loss weighs heavy on him now, and he has vowed to return, to reclaim the town that once called him Sheriff._

##### Sister Sophia

The San Miguel Mission sits atop a bluff on the East side of the Cowen river. It is the last hold out in the blighted lands near Brimstone. Refusing to abandon the church, Sister Sophia holds the line in the daily struggle against the demons and beasts that roam the hills. It is a beacon of hope in a wasteland of terror, offering safe haven to mutant and drifter alike.

**As you settle in for the night around the fire, there is an odd chill in the air. With a contorted face and twisted form, one of the posse is possessed by a vile demon, lashing out and speaking in tongues before regaining control! ‘You will all die before the might of the Ancient Ones...rez’chu’kau’to! Your souls will burn...Has’te’for’i... in the fires of Cynder! Beli’al will have his revenge!”**

The Hero that rolled this result immediately loses D3 Sanity permanently, and must roll once on the Madness chart as a result of this horrific experience.

### 4 - Void Storm
**A Void Storm has swept through the area, devastating the region, carrying away buildings, and mutating the livestock and people! It is not a pretty sight.**

### 5 - Living Hills

**Something’s not right here, the hills surrounding the valley you are in seem to be shifting and stirring before your eyes! The road before you opens up to reveal a massive demonic maw waiting to devour you whole!**

Each Hero must make an Agility 5+ test to avoid the maw! If passed, gain 15 XP and you escape the trap. If failed, you leap aside at the last moment. Any Cart or Horse you were riding is devoured by the beast and you lose 1 Sanity permanently at the horrific sight of the creature!

### 6 - Flash Flood

Each Hero must make a Cunning 5+ test. If passed, you recognize a scam when you see one and pass on the deal.
If failed, you eagerly buy some of the elixirs only to discover that they are little more than flavored water and pungent herbs as the dust cloud from the salesman’s cart disappears in the distance. Lose D6x$25 and roll a D6. On the roll of 6, one of the elixirs is actually worthwhile. Gain a Tonic Token.

### 9 - Burning Farmstead

### 16 - Massacred Wagon Train

# FAQ AND CLARIFICATIONS

Q) Because the Map Tiles are double-sided, what do you do if a Map card is drawn in an Other World, but the Mine side of that same tile is already in play?

A) Most players will want to remove older Map Tiles as they explore to make room for the new areas discovered as you go (unless you have a really giant table). That being the case, this won’t come up that often. When it does, simply discard the Map card and draw a new one to replace it.

Q) Do the Heroes get to draw a Loot for a Threat card that has you draw additional Threat cards but doesn’t actually add Enemies itself?

A) No. For Threat cards that say something like, “Draw 2 Low Threats”, the Heroes get Loot for each of the two Low Threats, but not for the card that just has you draw the Low Threats.

Q) What happens if no Map Tile can be placed at a Door because any tile would overlap an existing part of the map?

A) In this case, that exit is not a valid Door location when rolling for where the Doors are placed in that room.

Q) If you need to draw a card from a deck, and there are none left, what do you do?

A) Re-shuffle the discard pile back into the deck. If there is no discard pile, cancel that card draw. There are two exceptions to this. If an Artifact needs to be drawn and there are none available, draw a Gear card instead. If a Growing Dread needs to be drawn, draw a Darkness card instead.

Q) What happens if you look through a Gate while all of the World Cards are still in play?

A) This should be very rare as World Cards are returned to the Deck as soon as there are no Heroes in that World. If it does occur, the Gate will always lead back to the World you started the Adventure in (usually the Mines).

Q) If you are called on more than once to place additional Enemies when you don’t have any more models for them available, do they get an Elite ability for each time?

A) The Enemies gain an Elite ability when you would have to place more of them on the board but have no available models to do so. This is limited to once per turn, no matter how many instances of that Enemy you are called on to place but cannot.

Q) Is it ok to remove previous parts of the Map as you explore new areas (not all tables are giant)?

A) Yes. As long as you don’t think you will be going back to that area, it should be fine. This can also leave more room for the map to twist and turn and not be blocked by previous Map Tiles (imagine that it is winding down deeper as you go).

Q) Does an Enemy that is displaced, by a larger Enemy moving through it, need to choose a new target if it is still adjacent to its original target after being displaced?

A) No. The displaced Enemy will only select a new target if it is no longer adjacent to its original target.

Q) Does Spirit Armor prevent Corruption Points?

A) No, only Sanity Damage.

Q) If a new group of Enemies appears with Ambush during a Fight, and there are already Enemies of that Type on the board, do the existing Enemies of that Type get the +2 Initiative, or only the new Enemies?

A) All Enemies of that Type get the bonus +2 Initiative.

Q) What happens if you have a group of normal Enemies (such as Void Spiders) in an OtherWorld, and then a new group of Enemies enters play that are an OtherWorld variation on the same Enemy Type (such as Ancient Spiders)?

A) Unless you have models to specifically represent both Types of Enemies, all of these Enemies will immediately become the OtherWorld specific version of the Enemy Type (so in the example, the existing Void Spiders would immediately become Ancient Spiders).

Q) With the Encounter card Explosives, does a Hero get XP for Enemies killed by a blast going off?

A) No.

Q) Does the Bandido’s Swingin’ Fists Upgrade Ability affect Heroes as well?

A) Yes, so stand clear.

Q) How does the Growing Dread card Cosmic Insignificance work?

A) For every Willpower save failed, permanently reduce your Sanity by 1 rather than adding a Sanity Damage marker to your Hero.
