# Alignment Grid

This file (SVG and the generated PDF) prints an 1 mm alignment grid to test double sided printers.

IMHE (in my humble experience) printers that have double sided capabilities don't align very well. It dfepends also on paper grammature. SO you can print it and test your printer by yourself.
